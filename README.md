Hello, my name is Elijah Woelbing. I am a self-taught, self-motivated programmer. I have spent over two years actively building projects, and learning various computer science concepts. I am fluent in several programming languages. I have strong knowledge of programming fundamentals and actively expanding my expertise. I am seeking a job in the Software Development field, where I am challenged with the task of solving problems that ultimately improve people's lives. I have a strong desire to continue to learn and work in collaboration with others that share a common goal.
